# Riding to the Start

Joe told me about his plan: before he was 50, he said to me, he wanted to cross the alps on a bike. Knowing that I cycled too, he asked me if I’d want to join. 

Without thinking, I immediately agreed. We are both keen cyclists. He had seen my rides on Strava - and even if we were riding in different countries, we rode similar distances. His rides may have been a tad shorter, but the outskirts of the Pfälzerwald, where he lived, brought more elevation to his rides - more climbing to cover - than my rolling terrain around Cambridge. We were both 47, chatting as we were, at the rare occasion of being in the same city, at our school reunion in Bonn. It had been 30 years since we finished school. It was a nice gathering in an old restaurant next to the slightly majestic majors building, Altes Rathaus, in the city centre. I wasn’t even sure if he was serious, plus we had years before turning 50. What was the harm in saying yes.  

Fast forward 2 years. The Alps tour and been a wonderful three days on the road. It had involved major logistical hurdles to overcome, the largest of which had been taken care of in immaculate fashion by Joe. He had found the route, the hotels, made the bookings and even - this was the jewel in the crown, convinced his wife to act as team car and carry our luggage. She would be spending these days as a holiday with their three children. We’d start off together, Joe and I on our bikes, Nicole and the kids by car, and meet in the evening at the same hotel, my rucksack travelling in the trunk of their car.  It couldn’t be more convenient. 

My part was also challenging but eventually solved: fly to Zürich, hire a bicycle there, take the train from there to our start location Bregenz in Austria, right by Lake Constanz. Return via Zürich. Easy. 

That left the cycle route. Joe had chosen the following: Bregenz to Chur on day one, then Chur to Disentis on day two, and finally, over the Passo di Lucomagno, from Disentis to Brissago at the shores of the Lago Maggiore, on day three. In total, that made a distance of 276,8 km and 3177m of elevation to cover. Neither of us had ridden such a long distance on three consecutive days, or even attempted to ride up to an altitude of 1920m, or knew how our legs would cope with the 18 km of steady ascent up to the pass. We’d need to trust our legs and each other.

As it turned out - we were fine. There had been moments of awe and doubt. Looking up the hairpin turns just before Versam, knowing that there was no turning back - or worse, turning back just meant riding *up* the descent we’d just came down from - did give me a moment where I had to catch my breath - not from exhaustion but from a keen sense of ‘oh shit’.

Something else new for me was careening down roads at speeds upwards of 70km/h, only wearing lycra and thin gloves for protection. It helped to focus on the break points into the hairpin turns and not to look at the cycling computer.

All in all though, it was what one would call ‘an epic ride’. The views into Olivone were majestic, perfect blue skies framed the lush green in the valley. These views will stay with me for a long time.

On the flats our pace was very evenly matched. We took turns at the front, Joe knew the route off by heart and I had my trusted little Garmin to lead the way. On the climbs though, and to my surprise, I found myself, a fraction stronger than Joe. Not by much, and it really didn’t matter at all - we knew we’d be riding together no matter what - but just enough for me to notice. I would never have let him feel it, purposely drop my buddy. This ride had been his idea, he had organised it, his whole family was there, riding ahead in the car, my rucksack in their trunk. Of course we’d stay together. On the last hairpin though, just before the pass at 1920 m on the Lucomagno, I noticed him loose my wheel. It was steep. Legs were burning and giving way to the accumulated effort of riding strong for three days. I waited up, enough for him to catch me again. We rode on, Joe gave me a nod. 

This was such a delicate thing, because this three-day ride, across the alps no less -  was the first ride we had ever done together. Looking back, the decision to attempt crossing the Alps as our maiden shared ride together seems like madness. But then, as well as now, I trusted Joe. Somehow, I knew, we would find our rhythm.

That trust proved right. And thinking back now, it still catches me off guard — how much that simple, untested faith in each other meant. Enough that, even years later, recalling it brings me a string of tears.

Back then, it wasn’t just the new surroundings. It also brought me new ways of experiencing myself: feeling your legs ‘just ride’ even though your mind was reaching its’ limits. Usually, it is the other way around, my spirit is keen, but at some point my legs invariably call it a day. Now, on day three, it was the opposite: my mind was saying - ok, these were good days, time to check into a hotel - while my legs were telling me - let’s keep going, I got this, just ride buddy! 

And so we did, to my astonishment chasing down fellow cyclists heading for Bellinzona, Joe and me still somehow managing to keep the tempo high. 

We arrived in Brissago, empty but elated. We had done it. We set out at 427m above sea level in Bregenz, ridden up to 1920m to the Ospizio del Lucomagno, and back down to an elevation of about 200m in Switzerland, on the south side of the Alps. We had crossed the Alps. This remains my biggest cycling achievement - and on the rare occasion that I mention it to others, it elicits appropriate oohs and aahs. 

Fast forward a few more years, and another announcement from Joe. This time, I knew he meant it. “Sven,” he said, “why don’t we ride the Spreewald Marathon next April?” 

The ride was a common fixture in my new club. Thomas had ridden it the previous year - at the start of April - at 4°C, in the rain. It hadn’t been pleasant, he had said, which is cyclist speak for borderline traumatising. I had mentioned this to Joe a while ago - and it had stuck with him. Why not do it ourselves, was his response. 

This was a completely different challenge. For him, it would be the longest one-day ride yet: exactly 200 km. I had completed four rides over that distance, but that was in my heyday, the last one six years prior. My form had dipped noticeably since that time  — a move to Germany, which meant no regular Sunday clubrides, and then the Corona years had taken their toll. I seriously needed to get back in shape.

It was August. We still had a few months. I said yes — again trusting we’d be fine. We needed a goal to carry us through the winter. The Spreewald Marathon would give us exactly that. It meant at least one indoor session a week, side by side virtually, an hour of solid watts on pixelated roads around the world.

We set ourselves the goal to be ‘race ready’ by mit April. 

This time, logistics were comparatively a breeze: The start was an hour’s drive from my home. No flights, no alpine transfers. The Alps tour had been a different matter: flight from Stansted to Zürich, train to Bregenz, train from Locarno back to Zürich, rental bike in between — and, as luck or poor planning had it, a flight to New York on the following weekend.

Now, Joe carried the biggest travel burden. He drove the seven hours to my house on the Friday before the event on Saturday, with a short detour to Lübbenau to pick up our starting kits. That spared us the queue the next morning — for bike numbers, safety pins, roadbook, all the little paraphernalia that lend these events a sense of ceremony.

Still, a 7:30 a.m. start meant leaving the house at five. We reached the town at seven, got the bikes ready, and rolled out fifteen minutes early, quickly finding a rhythm and a fast group to follow. It was colder than expected, and we relied on our efforts to stay warm.

What Joe and I had anticipated, and both wanted keenly to avoid, of course happened. Riding 200 km in a single day is a serious effort and requires a good pacing and refuelling strategy to survive. During our preparations, Joe had been cautious — his longest ride had been 130 km. Solid, very solid, but still a full seventy kilometres short of what we would be doing today. I had done my 200s at an easy pace, nine to eleven hours on the road. My very first long ride — 236 km — took me fourteen hours, stops included, to complete. Joe and I had discussed this several times: we would take it easy, no rush, the only goal was to finish.

Once on the road, all those plans evaporated. We were excited to be riding together, the morning was chilly, the Sunday streets were empty. The adventure had begun. Inevitably, we rode too fast. So much for well-laid plans.

The devious thing about endurance events is that mistakes only show themselves much later. Your body has its own view of pacing and dealing with distance, and it doesn’t always match the plan. At 96 km, I glanced at my cycling computer. I saw an average speed far above our target. My body seemed to say: Ninety-six kilometres — that’s a ride, it declared. That’s enough. We’re finished, bye.

My legs were empty. My energy was gone. I slowed to half our previous speed. Another 100 km of this, five or more hours at this crawl. I was done.

This time, it was Joe who waited up. He simply rode next to me. I said, “This is going to be a long hundred k.” He said: “Just think about the next five.”

He was right. I focussed on the next corner, the next 500 metres; I just rode my own pace. Other riders passed us without comment. Soon we reached a village, the farthest point of the route. From here on, every turn meant getting closer to the finish line. 

And then, a few minutes later, through some trick of physiology, my legs returned. We took up the pace again and made the forty kilometres to the next feed station in good time. We refuelled with cake, half a banana, and more isotonic mix, then pushed on.

At 5:35 p.m. we rolled over the finish line. Our ride time was seven hours and fifty minutes, a full hour and a half faster than anything I’d done before. 

The organisers had laid out that everyone who arrived before six would be awarded a gold medal — in the shape of a pickled gherkin. Yes, a small knobbly golden metal cucumber. The Spreewald is Germany’s cucumber heartland, hence the prize. Joe and I duly accepted our golden gherkins, and proudly hung them around our necks. Again, the sense of achievement was intense. 

Having won a golden gherkin comes with a certain cache, and the news travelled fast in my new German club. Kudos and well wishes ensued. 

But, as ever, we didn’t do it for the accolades. Cycling, at our level, which means just below amateur level, is not a team sport. It is nice to have cycling buddies or to belong to a club. Slipstream is most certainly very noticeable - but essentially cycling is very a solitary sport. It’s you and your bike. Many miles are spent solo on the road. Training is on you and you alone. You don’t get passed a ball, you don’t tackle an opponent or catch a rebound. It’s just you. 

Maybe for that reason, there exists a strong sense of camaraderie among cyclists. On group rides, etiquette dictates that you keep your line, point out hazards and indicate turns and stops clearly and ahead of time. If someone has a puncture, the whole group waits and one person will assist, while the others will not add to the annoyance by being impatient or in any other way add pressure. Changing a flat tyre is enough of a chore on a good day, let alone when you have a group of riders waiting to get a move on hovering over you. This is where you are called upon to showcase all your calm exterior and keep a safe distance.

In short, we look out for each other, in ways that are imperceptible to most people. Pointing out a pothole before you swerve means the person riding behind you has the chance to do the same and won’t risk ruining their cherished rims. Taking a turn at the front means your fellow riders now get the benefit from your slipstream, and can save costly watts over the next few kilometres. You acknowledge other riders with a short wave, and you thank another rider with a simple nod. These are the rules we live by when on the bike. 

As the years pass on you acquire additional responsibilities, not just knowledge about yourself and the experiences of riding epic rides. It turns out, all these rides are just the preamble. Let me explain.

As I write this, I am ten days away from another marathon ride. It will be a large circular route around Berlin, 227 km to be exact. There will be 4 “Kontrollstellen” or feed stations along the way. This ride will be without Joe, but with my new club mates and, crucially, three youngsters, on their first 200. As any parent will know - teaching the next generation is an exercise in extreme patience.

The usual ride of these three has never exceeded 100k. The biggest challenge is always managing your effort, not expending all your energy at the outset. And even then, one has to manage refuelling. We don’t have the reserves to last us through 8 or more hours of solid riding. The feed stations are essential, but 40 to 60km apart. It is fully possible to bonk out between them. Take some gels - is the first line of defence, always have some quick carbs at the ready. Even that has to be managed - and the mental discipline to refuel regularly and early is not yet part of their usual ride routine. Experience is the only teacher.

This mindset shift is essential, for without it you are not going to enjoy yourself over such a distance. If you want to instill such a shift in mindset - you run into a secondary issue: youthful exuberance and unwillingness to listen. One has to be subtle.

For me this meant reframing the distance: we will be riding to the start. The start, which is 100km away. Our first task will be getting there. On bike. We should arrive there with enough energy to do ‘a usual club ride’ of 100km. This way, we can’t expend all our energies too early. Pacing built in. In two weeks time I will know if and how this turned out. 

I am also just riding to the start.
