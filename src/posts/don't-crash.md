Anyone who knows me somewhat, will have heard that I really love cycling. I am a firm believer in the ‘Velominati’, or the ‘Keepers of the Cogs’ who have compiled ‘The Rules’ of Cycling. These rules are strict, and firmly tongue in cheek. Nonetheless, they must be adhered to rigorously, of course.

My own cycling prowess is below that of an amateur, if we’re defining an ‘amateur’ with the deserving gravitas – as someone who regularly participates in races just below professional level. In cycling parlance, I would consider myself an enthusiast, which is above a hobbyist or a recreational cyclist. As such, an enthusiast is a member of a cycling club, rides regularly with the lads (and lasses), and of course wears lycra. Weekly distances approach three digits and you have several centuries under the belt - rides above 100km if it’s a metric century, or 100 miles, if it is an imperial one - if you measure in miles, which, according to the Rules, one does not.

You are on Strava; giving out kudos to your fellow bike buddies, keeping your gear in pristine condition and enjoying the rides. It is a sport - whereby the competition isn’t your fellow bike friends; but daily life, scheduling conflicts, fatigue and sore legs.

By this stage I have a few set routes that I ride. Depending on available time I have a short route (S: 19.3 km), an extended version (xS: 24 km), and a medium length route (M: 47 km). Longer rides are ridden with the club, and range from 60 - 100 km on a given day. Those are my favourite rides by far. Riding in a group means you have company and a set start time. It gives you the opportunity either ‘take a turn’ - meaning to be up front in the wind - or else be ‘on the wheel’ of someone riding ahead of you. Slipstream is a thing, noticeably.

Solo rides are very different - there is no set start time, for starters. As anyone who regularly deals with deadlines knows, this is both a good thing and a bad thing. Deadlines help focus. A solo ride means you are the boss, but also means that there is nobody waiting for you. You set the pace, determine your level of exertion, and you have the notion that you can stop for a breather at any time you want to. This never happens, though, or hardly ever. If I’m alone on the bike, I ride.

Today I had a concrete and different plan: I have two bikes. The first is a beautiful, serene and elegant pure road bike. Slender, in a grey/silver finish, with normal racing handlebars. I’ve ridden this bike for more than a decade now. According to Strava, I have clocked up over 15.000 km on it. I love this bike.

A few years after buying this one, I also treated myself to a pure time trial bike. It is a very different ride. Aero TT handlebars, with narrow, padded arm extensions, hands out front; able to reach the gear shifters up ahead. The brake levers, on the other hand, are located on the wide part of the handlebars, shaped somewhat like the bizarre protrusions of a hammerhead shark. This setup has the advantage of being maximally aerodynamic when riding: head facing downwards, shoulders narrowed as much as possible, arms and hands extended in front of the face; grabbing the extension bars.

There are two very acute disadvantages to such a riding position. The first is that you are looking nearly straight downwards, maybe three to five meters ahead of you. If you want to see the road ahead - and why wouldn’t you - you need to crane your neck back to look up. This is uncomfortable, but you need to do it to see where you are going. You can then drop your gaze back down once you’ve taken in the course immediately ahead of you, and hope that no car, no pedestrian, no stray dog or overlooked wet patch of leaves appears on the road.

The second disadvantage is that while your hands are up ahead, on the extensions, you have no brakes. These are located on the other part of the handlebars, slightly behind your hands, and to the sides. You have to let go of the extensions, move one hand back and across and grab hold of the outside part of the handlebars. Only then can you brake. If you have to make a split second decision, this method is no good.

On a regular road bike, you ride mostly with your hands on the hoods, the back of the brake levers themselves. Your fingers even often cup the actual brakes, as they are also used to shift gears. In an emergency, you can brake within a fraction of a second. On a normal road bike, that is. Not on a time trial bike. These are the drawbacks of the extreme aero position.

The upside is you go faster. That is proven, tested, trialled. Everything about how you sit on a Time Trial bike is geared toward maximal speed, not just the position of your arms. Your shoulders are crouched, reducing drag, your hips are higher, the angle at which your glutes and thighs operate let you push down maximal power onto the pedals. It works better. Time Trial bikes are faster. It’s physics.

I love both bikes. I ride only one. While both are beautiful pure manifestations of cycling ability, the comfort and safety on a road bike are just so much higher than on a time trial bike. I have clocked up less than 1000 km on my TT bike. Today, I wanted to add to that tally.

My goal was to ride my shortest route: just under 20k. It is a route I know very well. The roads aren’t heavily frequented by cars and there are cycle lanes on certain sections. I know the distances between corners, know where I need to look up, where I can safely tuck in and ride hard. I wanted to beat my best time, which was just under 40 minutes: 39’34”. This equalled to an average speed of 29.3 km/h. My goal was to break the 30 km/h mark. This meant I had to ride that distance in 38’36”, just under one minute faster. I knew this was doable.

The biggest win and improvement on time is simply to warm up thoroughly at home on the stationary bike. This alone means I can head out and ride at tempo immediately. I would make up that minute with this trick alone (on normal rides I don’t have a tempo goal, so the first one or two kilometers are my warm up). Any additonal improvements would be down to the Time Trial bike. My only concern here was: Don’t crash.

I did as planned. Warming up for fifteen minutes meant I was ready to head out and quickly get myself into a good rhythm. Everything went well for the first kilometers after this, too. I had to cross a big road and wait at a traffic light. My little cycling computer gracefully paused the ride while I wasn’t moving. I took up speed again and headed my way down past The New Palais in the park of Sanssouci, the majestic baroque summer residence of the Prussian Emperors. That led to my favourite stretch of road: a 2km long and even section in the woods. At 6 km in, it was too early in the ride to take at full gas.

I crossed the railway line shortly after, headed through the underpass in Golm, and came up the treacherous “climb” at the Max-Planck campus. It is the most annoying section of my route - 0.7 km of uphill -but at such a shallow gradient that one constantly thinks one should be going much faster. It is also just after the half-way point of the ride, but I didn’t have the presence of mind to calculate if I was within my target time.

A few ondulations follow, bringing me back into the town I live in. A steady light uphill section leads to the last traffic light before I turn left and head back the same road I came down on. 3 km to go. I kept the pace high, heartrate above my lactate threshold, power over 200W. Two more tight bends and I braked in front of my house. Hit ‘end ride’ on the cycling computer. Under 38 minutes would be great. I came in at 36’59”, more than two and a half minutes below my previous personal best.

After some recovery time, a banana smoothie, and the quick shower that followed - still only wearing a towel - I went through the mail of the day. Some bad news, bills and late fees. And then I remembered - you can also crash when you’re not on the bike.
