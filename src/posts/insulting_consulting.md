# Why Do We Consult - and Whom

I have applied to about a dozen consultancy vacancies. People I know well and trust have said I'd be a good fit - just before they said it would be madness to apply there. 

At my old company, in my previous role, we did a fair share of consulting. The company *started life* as a consultancy after all. Genomics consulting (that wasn't the name of the Company mind you).

Over several years of work with large clients, I thought I'd gotten the hang of what large corporations are looking for when they hire consultants. Expertise, insights, actionable ones, if possible.

And that is what we did - delivered actionable insights, curtesy of our - joint - expertise. Why wouldn't everybody be happy?

Now - in the next phase™ of my career - why not double down and join one of the big houses and offer my services to them first ? Accenture, PwC, Gartner, BCG, EY. 

EY declined my application - kindly so - within two days. Hats off to that sort of efficiency. BCG took a bit longer, IQVIA never bothered to reply at all. To either of my applications. Fair enough - they are busy.

But the question remains - why do we need consultants in the first place ? What value does a company bring, that enters your premises, collects information *of your work* only to then sell it back to you, albeit in a different font ? 

Maybe I am missing something here. Or maybe I have been in too many consultancy meetings. Lived through endless "value proposition enhancement" presentations and "roadmap consolidation" sessions. Who is to know. 

To me - who values originality more than performance, who was taught to be critical and discrimate substance from packaging, to seek insight rather than confirmation - I find consulting insulting. 

I do see the need. Or at least the generated need Consultancies have created. Much like Cheese Stuffed Crust Pizza. Born out of the need to find more places to put a highly processed dairy product in. 

Life moves on and new needs emerge. As such - I want to outline a more smooth and effortless solution to the need to hire a consultancy firm that in the end tells you what you already know - and charges an arm, a leg, and two kidneys for their services. 

What we have, is a classical tragedy in three acts:

### Part I: The Diagnosis

- Symptom: Clients pay for clarity, but get buzzword fog.
- Symptom: Consultants rehearse theatre, clients play along.
- Symptom: Knowledge is recycled, nuance stripped, respect goes missing.


### Part II: The Malaise

- Addiction - The industry is addicted to its own rituals.
- Stasis - Incentives hinder progress: billable hours are more important than lasting change.
- Fear — Consultants fear showing weakness, clients fear saying “I already knew that.”
- Homogeny — You cannot become a Consultant unless you've *been* a Consultant

So what is Part III - the Cure ? 


### Part III: The Cure (Infinite Advisory Loop™ — Executive Summary)

After extensive stakeholder alignment, we are proud to introduce Self-Consulting as a Service (SCaaS™).

Through our proprietary framework, clients are empowered to self-consult with unprecedented efficiency. By harnessing our cloud-native Self-Billing Platform™, clients invoice themselves directly, eliminating the consultant middleman while maximising billable hours.

Key Features:
- Trademarked Framework™ — Ensures every insight is simultaneously obvious and unobtainable without facilitation.
- Automated Self-Billing™ — Clients pay themselves, guaranteeing cash neutrality while sustaining perpetual revenue cycles.
- Terms & Conditions Apply™ — Ensures no liability rests with either client or consultant, as both now share a unified legal entity: The Loop.

Pricing Model:
- No fees due until the first invoice is generated.
- From then on, fees are continuous, compounding, and infinite.

With SCaaS™, respect is finally achieved: the client no longer needs the consultant, because the client has become the consultant. Transformation complete.
