    <h1>Why Do We Consult - and Whom</h1>
<p>I have applied to about a dozen consultancy vacancies. People I know well and trust have said I'd be a good fit - just before they said it would be madness to apply there.</p>
<p>At my old company, in my previous role, we did a fair share of consulting. The company <em>started life</em> as a consultancy after all. Genomics consulting (that wasn't the name of the Company mind you).</p>
<p>Over several years of work with large clients, I thought I'd gotten the hang of what large corporations are looking for when they hire consultants. Expertise, insights, actionable ones, if possible.</p>
<p>And that is what we did - delivered actionable insights, curtesy of our - joint - expertise. Why wouldn't everybody be happy?</p>
<p>Now - in the next phase(tm) of my career - why not double down and join one of the big houses and offer my services to them first ? Accenture, PwC, Gartner, BCG, EY.</p>
<p>EY declined my application - kindly so - within two days. Hats off to that sort of efficiency. BCG took a bit longer, IQVIA never bothered to reply at all. To either of my applications. Fair - they are busy.</p>
<p>But the question remains - why do we need consultants in the first place ? What value does a company bring, that enters your premises, collects information <em>of your work</em> only to then sell it back to you, albeit in a different font ?</p>
<p>Maybe I am missing something here. Or maybe I have been in too many consultancy meetings. Lived through endless &quot;value proposition enhancement&quot; presentations and &quot;roadmap consolidation&quot; sessions. Who is to know.</p>
<p>To me - who values originality more than performance, who was taught to be critical and discrimate substance from packaging, to seek insight rather than confirmation - I find consulting insulting.</p>
<p>I do see the need. Or at least the generated need Consultancies have created. Much like Cheese Stuffed Crust Pizza. Born out of the need to find more place to put a highly processed dairy product in.</p>
<p>Life moves on and new needs emerge. As such - I want to outline a more smooth and effortless solution to the need to hire a consultancy firm that in the end tells you what you already know - and charges an arm, a leg, and two kidneys for their services.</p>
<p>What we have, is a classical tragedy in three acts:</p>
<h3>Part I: The Malaise</h3>
<ul>
<li>Symptom: Clients pay for clarity, but get buzzword fog.</li>
<li>Symptom: Consultants rehearse theatre, clients play along.</li>
<li>Symptom: Knowledge is recycled, nuance stripped, respect goes missing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part II: The Diagnosis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Addiction - The industry is addicted to its own rituals.</li>
<li>Stasis - Incentives hinder progress: billable hours are more important than lasting change.</li>
<li>Fear — Consultants fear showing weakness, clients fear saying “I already knew that.”</li>
<li>Homogeny — You cannot become a Consultant unless you've <em>been</em> a Consultant</li>
</ul>
<p>So what is Part III - the Cure ?</p>
<h3>Part III: The Cure (Infinite Advisory Loop™ — Executive Summary)</h3>
<p>After extensive stakeholder alignment, we are proud to introduce Self-Consulting as a Service (SCaaS™).</p>
<p>Through our proprietary framework, clients are empowered to self-consult with unprecedented efficiency. By harnessing our cloud-native Self-Billing Platform™, clients invoice themselves directly, eliminating the consultant middleman while maximising billable hours.</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trademarked Framework™ — Ensures every insight is simultaneously obvious and unobtainable without facilitation.</li>
<li>Automated Self-Billing™ — Clients pay themselves, guaranteeing cash neutrality while sustaining perpetual revenue cycles.</li>
<li>Terms &amp; Conditions Apply™ — Ensures no liability rests with either client or consultant, as both now share a unified legal entity: The Loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing Model:</p>
<ul>
<li>No fees due until the first invoice is generated.</li>
<li>From then on, fees are continuous, compounding, and infinite.</li>
</ul>
<p>With SCaaS™, respect is finally achieved: the client no longer needs the consultant, because the client has become the consultant. Transformation complete.</p>
