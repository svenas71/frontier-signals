In Britain, in the year 1306, King Edward of England passed a law banning the burning of coal to generate heat. The pollution had become so bad, that in 1285, a commission in London was appointed to get rid of the smog and filthy air (https://historyfacts.com/world-history/fact/the-first-environmental-law-was-passed-in-1306), which caused bad smell and would linger in the city for days.</p><p>Again and again, attempts have been made to clean up the air, the waters, our soil. We see to it that food production does not include too many harmful pesticides, carcinogens or pathogens. We are used to the fact that bread that we buy will only contain bread, flour only flour and we can with full confidence buy a ready meal from any supermarket and expect to not have any ill-effects from eating it. </p><p>Not so with information. It took us centuries to fully understand the link between certain molecules and our health. Functionally. We now know that asbestos can cause lung cancer, that nitrosamines are formed in chargrilled meats and are harmful - the list is long and well established. </p><p>What we - collectively, as global societies - have not yet come to grips with, is that the same concept holds true for information. Certain information can be harmful and has ill-effect on people. In extreme cases we acknowledge this and call it ‘radicalisation’. Highly susceptible people have been made to harm themselves or others in real life - only through use of information. We see this as an aberration. Strange edge cases that compel us to shudder and shy away from a more thorough investigation. But it happens whole-sale, too. We still let asbestos into our social media. We still let gunk fill otherwise valuable information channels.</p><p>Elon Musk - one of the biggest wholesalers of information-gunk on the planet - has just purchased a whole distribution network to sell his low quality, fascism enabling information.</p><p>Robert Habeck, the German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, has recently stated that X (nee Twitter) and TikTok need regulatory oversight. Their algorithms were not in line with our expectations for supporting a healthy society and functioning democracy. He is of course right. Just as a sausage maker needs to adhere to safety and health standards, so does a whole seller of information. Regardless of sourcing of ingredients. </p><p>Musk, showing the pavlovian response of a 19th century factory owner, responded with (in German!) “Habeck ist ein Narr”. </p><p>The age of enlightenment has taught us that harmful molecules exist, and can cause harm to every single one of our organs. There is one organ though, that in addition to molecules, processes information. It is that organ which you are now relying on to read this text. Don’t let a class of ruthless and sequestered business magnates tell you otherwise. Information is functional, we need to treat it as such.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
