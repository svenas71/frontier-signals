<p>A restaurant in the busy part of town. Simple diner furniture. The waiter approaches our customer and hands him the menu.</p><p>With a nod and a careful look, our customer studies the menu. It contains two items to choose from. The Chicken Dish, and, as a second option, Nuclear Armageddon.</p><p>The customer, slightly confused, wants to know more about the choices.</p><p>“So the Chicken Dish”, the waiter starts, “is a breast of chicken and it comes with the sides of boiled potatoes, carrots and other seasonal vegetables. Served with a chicken-vegetable sauce and bacon strips”</p><p>Our customer nods in appreciation and recognition.</p><p>“Yes” he says. “And what about this other dish: Nuclear Armageddon”</p><p>The waiter coughs slightly and nods. “Yes sir, that is our second option for today”</p><p>“Tell me about that dish. What is it and what does it come with”</p><p>The waiter, unmoved, replies:</p><p>“That sir, is nuclear winter. The arsenals of all major atomic forces are emptied over our skies. Intercontinental missiles are launched, and strike in one hundred large American cities”</p><p>“I see” the customer says. “And what does that come with”.</p><p>The waiter pulls out a notepad and begins to read from it: “Sir, it comes with radiation sickness, complete hair loss and hemorrhagia, annihilation of your immune cells, genetic damage, widespread destruction and, as an optional extra and for ten dollars, quick and painless death”.</p><p>“That is quite a list” the customer says, impressed.</p><p>“Indeed sir” the waiter agrees, patiently.</p><p>The customer holds the menu and looks up at waiter.</p><p>“The thing is” he starts, “I’ve already had the Chicken”.</p>
